# 🌍 SocioRelief
**Optimizing global disaster relief fund distribution using K-Means Clustering & PCA**  

---

## 📌 Overview  
In times of disasters and natural calamities, **efficient allocation of relief funds** is crucial for minimizing impact and ensuring equitable support.  
This project leverages **unsupervised machine learning** techniques — **K-Means Clustering** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** — to group countries based on socio-economic indicators and optimize fund allocation.  

By clustering countries with similar disaster vulnerability and socio-economic profiles, policymakers and NGOs can make **data-driven decisions** for better humanitarian outcomes.

## 🎯 Key Features  
- ✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified patterns, trends, and outliers across 167 countries  
- ✅ **Feature Engineering:** Normalized socio-economic and disaster-related indicators  
- ✅ **Dimensionality Reduction:** Applied PCA to reduce feature space and improve clustering performance  
- ✅ **Clustering Optimization:** Used **Elbow Method** & **Silhouette Score** to determine the optimal number of clusters  
- ✅ **Actionable Insights:** Generated clusters to guide equitable disaster relief allocation
